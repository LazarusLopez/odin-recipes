            <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened (very soft)
            </li>
            <li>¾ cup powdered Swerve Sweetener
            </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream divided</li>
            <h4>Garnish (optional)</h4>
            <li>Cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Shaved dark chocolate</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h4>Cake</h4>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F and grease 2 8-inch round cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment and grease the parchment.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, protein powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter with the sweeteners until well combined and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl and beaters as needed. Beat in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Beat in the almond flour mixture, then beat in the coffee, sour cream, and apple cider vinegar until well combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture evenly between the cake pans and spread to the edges. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until the cakes have risen and the tops are firm to the touch.</li>
            <li>Remove and let cool completely in the pan. Then run a sharp knife around the edges to loosen and flip the cakes out.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h4>Frosting</h4>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter and cream cheese together until very smooth. Beat in the sweetener until well combined, then beat in the vanilla. Beat in ¼ cup of the cream until smooth.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, beat the remaining ¾ cup whipping cream until it holds stiff peaks. Carefully fold the whipped cream into the butter mixture until well combined.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h4>Assembly</h4>
            <li>Place one layer of cake on a platter and spread with about ⅓ of the frosting, all the way to the edges. Top with the second layer of cake and spread the top with about ⅓ of the frosting.</li>
            <li>Spread the remaining frosting over the sides. Refrigerate 30 minutes to help firm up the frosting.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <h4>Garnish (optional)</h4>
            <li>Sprinkle the top with cocoa powder and shaved dark chocolate, if desired.</li>
        </ul>
