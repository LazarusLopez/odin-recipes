        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This crazy mixed up low carb cake is truly delicious stuff! Keto chocolate cake swirled together with sugar-free cheesecake, pecans, and coconut for a healthy take on the famous earthquake cake.</p>
        <p>Earthquake cakes typically take shredded coconut, chopped pecans, and plenty of chocolate chips. But if any one of these additions doesn’t appeal to you, feel free to leave them out. They are not critical to the outcome of the cake itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped pecans</li>
            <li>2 cups almond flour</li>
            <li>½ cup Swerve Sweetener</li>
            <li>⅓ cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup unflavoured whey protein powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>14 tablespoon butter melted, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup cold coffee or water coffee helps boost chocolate flavor</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>8 ounces cream cheese softened</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered Swerve Sweetener</li>
            <li>½ cup sugar-free chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325F and grease a 9x13 baking pan. Sprinkle the bottom with the shredded coconut and the pecans.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, sweetener, cocoa powder, protein powder, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the eggs, 6 tablespoon melted butter, coffee or water, and vanilla extract until well combined. Pour over the coconut and pecans.</li>
            <li>In another large bowl, beat the cream cheese with the remaining 8 tablespoon melted butter until smooth. Beat in the powdered sweetener. Dollop this mixture over the cake mixture by the spoonful. Use a knife to swirl into the cake mixture, scraping all the way to the bottom in some places to mix up the coconut and pecans.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with the chocolate chips. Bake for about 45 minutes, until cake is mostly set through (will still be slightly soft and liquidy in the  middle). Remove and let cool at least 20 minutes before serving.</li>
